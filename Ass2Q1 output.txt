Coefficients in original basis are given as:  [0.5746586674195995, 4.725861442142078, -11.128217777643616, 7.6686776229096685]
Coefficients in modified Chebyshev basis:  [1.1609694790335525, 0.39351446798815237, 0.04684983209010658, 0.23964617571596986]

######
The condition number for the original basis for the corresponding matrix is 21980.9  and the condition number in the case of the modified Chebyshev functions was found to be 4.79553.

######
As a rule of thumb, if the condition number $\kappa (A)=10^{k}$ , then you may lose up to k digits of accuracy.
Here from our analysis we can see that k ~ 4 for original chebyshev and k ~ 1 for modified basis.
Modified chebyshev basis are better choice.
